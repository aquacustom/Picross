We were able to polish off the game board and made it look a lot nicer than milestone 2. 
We also were able to implement pre-made boards that are randomly generated. 
In addition to our goals we were able to implement a button that allowed for the user to choose the size of the board they want to play with. 
We also implemented saving the state of the board which we did not complete from milestone 2. 
We did not complete our stretch goal of incorporating colored blocks into the game but we were able to incorporate our stretch goal of adding a leadership board for the players.
